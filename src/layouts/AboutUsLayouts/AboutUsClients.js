            <p>
              Building customer trust in the food industry requires time,
              effort, and great passion. For Alfonsoâ€™s, it began in 1988 with a
              humble pizza outlet in Makati. The experience gained during those
              early years paved the way for small time canteen operations and
              catering to small private functions. Gradually, service offerings
              expanded to cater to more elaborate events in and out of Metro
              Manila. This eventually led to the incorporation of Seafood
              Ventures Corporation, a company whose main focus is to provide
              catering services to private and public institutions around the
              country.

              Mrs. Alice Patag, the hands-on CEO of the company, manages
              day-to-day operations and conducts quality inspections in catering
              functions. Her active involvement in all aspects of the business
              ensures that client needs and concerns are immediately addressed.
              She is ably supported by a seasoned pool of managers with the
              expertise to do what it takes to create truly memorable events. As
              the organization continues to grow, we equip employees with the
              necessary training that enables them not just to respond, but to
              anticipate our customers' needs.
